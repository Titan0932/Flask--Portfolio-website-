This is a template for a portfolio website. The frontend design is fairly simple here because the focus was made on 
the backend component for this project. It is only partly filled with content.

This website allows only permitted users with the correct password to enter and access the portfolio. Users can log in and log out. 5 minutes of inactivity
automatically terminates the session.

It also stores the logged-in user credentials in an sqlAlchemy database and database operations can also be done!

Made with Flask.
